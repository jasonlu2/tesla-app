# Tesla Stock Data Shiny App

## Project Overview

Since I bought a measly 0.3 shares of TSLA on November 9 2023, I got more intrigued by the stock market (and its ability to grow the money I had), and I would frequently talk about it with my friends, who probably had hundreds of times more shares of Tesla than I did. So of course I thought this would be a fun little project.

This Shiny App is an interactive tool designed to provide an in-depth analysis of Tesla stock data. This app allows users to visualize various aspects of Teslaâ€™s stock performance, including open prices, close prices, volumes traded, ranges of prices, and frequencies by day of the week to help visualize if any trends exist/overlap. The tool is built to offer real-time data interaction, customizable visualizations, and the ability to display descriptive statistics.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive interface designed for easy navigation and data selection.
- **Multiple Variables**: Options to plot Open price, Close price, Volume traded, Range of price, and Day of week.
- **Customization Options**: Users can select the color of the plots and choose to display descriptive statistics.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Sliders to adjust the date and data ranges dynamically.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Option to display correlations and proportions based on the selected variable.

## How It Works

### User Interface

- **Title Panel**: Displays the title "Tesla Stock Data," along with the Tesla company logo.
- **Sidebar Panel**: Provides controls for selecting variables, plot colors, and toggling descriptive statistics.
- **Main Panel**: Shows the selected variable's plot and, if enabled, descriptive statistics or frequency tables.

### Steps of Operation

1. **Data Loading**:
   - Reads the Tesla stock data from a CSV file (`TSLA.csv`).
   - Transforms the data using libraries such as `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, and `ggplot2`.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Converts the `date` variable to date format.
   - Creates new variables such as `weekday`, `maxRange`, and `date_numeric`.
   - Factors the `weekday` variable for accurate plotting.

3. **Plotting**:
   - Generates scatterplots for Open price, Close price, Volume traded, and Range of price.
   - Creates bar plots for the frequency of stock data by the day of the week.
   - Allows customization of plot colors and data range through user inputs.

4. **Descriptive Statistics**:
   - Computes and displays the correlation between time and the selected variable.
   - For the "Day of Week" option, displays a table of proportions.
